# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview:
The purpose of this repository is to use OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather description data for 2,000 random cities. This data is then used to create a custom travel destinations map (with Google Maps API) depending on the userâ€™s preferred destination temperature. From this destination map, a travel itinerary was created for 4 cities in Australia.
